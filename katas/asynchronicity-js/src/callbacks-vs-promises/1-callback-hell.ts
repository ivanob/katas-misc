/**
 * Explanations:
 * writeFile: writes in a file whatever it returns the third parameter that it receives as parameter.
 * getUsersFromApi: its an API call (mocked) that returns the list of users, it receives a callback that is
 * executed when the users are fetched
 * appendFile: appends whatever we pass as second parameter to the file. When it is done, it calls the callback
 * copyFile: copies a file in the filesystem to the destination received in the second param and calls the callback
 * unlink: closes the file and calls the callback, which is a console.log
