/**
 * The idea is to promisify the functions I was calling before so instead of receiving a callback 
 * to call when they finish their execution, they will return a promise instead that we can handle
 * with the then/catch methods.
 * 
 * Just to save time I have promisified a couple of callback-style functions... and the rest I have
 * just imported its promisified version already cause its available to be used.
 * 
 * Important: the point of returning the calls we are doing in the 'then' is to allow to continue
 * chaining thens.
